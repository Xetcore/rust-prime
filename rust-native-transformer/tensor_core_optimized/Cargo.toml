# FLOAT_TOLERANCE in tests might need approx if not already using it,
# or if direct float comparison needs more robust handling.
# For now, assuming existing test structure is fine.
# If tests are copied verbatim and used `assert_eq` for floats, they might become flaky.
# The existing `assert_f32_slice_eq` and `assert_tensors_approx_equal` use a manual tolerance.
